# nelua.vim

Syntax highlighting for [Nelua](https://nelua.io/) programming language.

## Contributing

Kindly requesting the help of Vim experts as I'm facing some
issues with specific operations and expression highlightings.

If anyone is willing to help, I would be more than grateful.

## Credits

This project is based on `lua.vim` found in
`/usr/share/vim/vim82/syntax/lua.vim` under GNU / Linux Debian distro.

Special gratitude goes to its original author(s) and current maintainer(s).
